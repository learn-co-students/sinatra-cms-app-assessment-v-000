# Bon Voyage Travel Application

## Description

The Bon Voyage travel application is a platform where users can share travel recommendations with each other. Members of the community make a public request letting other users know that they will be traveling to another city and asking for any travel recommendations. Other members are able to respond to the travel requests by making recommendations based on any previous travel experiences. The Bon Voyage application encourages users to share any travel recommendations with each other in order to enhance all users' travel experiences.
