The goal to this project is to be able to login as a user and as that user, you can add new game titles that you have completed.

You will be able to add new games once you've completed them and you can also edit or delete games if you enter something wrong.

To install you will change directories(cd game_changer), then run bundle install, then run shotgun and copy and paste the server number(Your server is running at 165.227.60.187:35871) into the browser.
