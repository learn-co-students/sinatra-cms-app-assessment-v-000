# Sinatra Content Management System App

## Overview

For this assessment you'll be creating any sort of CRUD app. The app should be a custom app that is created to track something important to you. Whether that's your golf club collection, or a travel app. These types of apps are generally referred to as CRUD (Create Read Update Delete apps) or simple Content Management Systems.

## Requirements

1. Build an MVC Sinatra Application.
2. Use ActiveRecord with Sinatra.
3. Use Multiple Models.
4. Use at least one `has_many` relationship
5. Must have user accounts. The user that created a given piece of content should be the only person who can modify that content
6. You should validate user input to ensure that bad data isn't created


### Example Domains

 - [Golf Club Organizer](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/example-sinatra-assessment)
 - [Todo List](http://todomvc.com). Each task is part of a list
 - Collection of useful Ruby resources

If you are unsure about a domain or can't come up with an idea, feel free to reach out to fullstack@learn.co for some advice.

### Domains To Avoid

 As we spent a lot of time working with domains similiar to these during the Sinatra curriculum we do not accept these domain designs. 
  - Twitter Clone 
  - Blog Application
  
### Recomendations

 You do not have to make your routes any more complicated than `http://yourapp.com/posts/1`. We want to see you build a great CRUD application but we are not requiring you to build the next AirBnB. 

## Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub for your Sinatra Application.
2. When you create the Sinatra app for your assessment, add the spec.md file from this repo to the root directory of the project, commit it to Git and push it up to GitHub.
3. Build your application. Make sure to commit early and commit often. Commit messages should be meaningful (clearly describe what you're doing in the commit) and accurate (there should be nothing in the commit that doesn't match the description in the commit message). Good rule of thumb is to commit every 3-7 mins of actual coding time. Most of your commits should have under 15 lines of code and a 2 line commit is perfectly acceptable. **This is important and you'll be graded on this**.
4. While you're working on it, record a 30 min coding session with your favorite screen capture tool. During the session, either think out loud or not. It's up to you. You don't need to submit the video, but we may ask for it at a later time.
5. Make sure to create a good README.md with a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code.
6. Make sure to check each box in your spec.md (replace the space between the square braces with an x) and explain next to each one how you've met the requirement *before* you submit your project.
7. Prepare a short video demo (narration helps!) describing how a user would interact with your working application.
8. Write a blog post about the project and process.
9. When done, submit your GitHub repo's url, a link to your video demo, and a link to your blog post in the corresponding text boxes in the right rail. Hit "I'm done" to wrap it up.

Unlike the rest of the curriculum, if you have any questions about your assessment or need help with it, please *don’t* use the Ask New Question feature. Rather than working with Learn Experts, please reach out to the Learn Instructor responsible for this section instead - Cernan / cernan@flatironschool.com / learn-co slack: cernanb.

## If you're a Learn-Verified Premium student:

We'll send an email to you soon to schedule a pairing process. If you don't hear from us in 48 hours after submission, get in touch!

### Be Prepared to:

1. Confirm your application meets the requirements above. We'll go through your app and ask you to show us how it meets the requirements above. 5-10 mins.
2. Explain your code from execution point to exit point. We're making sure you wrote it and understand how it works. 10-15 mins.
3. Live coding, doing a refactoring exercise to make sure you're comfortable working with your code. 10-15 mins.

### What to expect from the pairing session

- Use the best vocabulary you can. Technical terms allow for you to be more precise which makes conversations about code much easier.
- If you make a mistake, correct yourself! We all make mistakes, I promise.
- Trust yourself
- Trust us
- Think on your feet. Feel free to look things up while you're pairing with us. You'll be asked to expand on concepts you implemented and you will be pushed to the edge of your knowledge.
- Explain the details. We're curious!
- You're going to learn a ton. We will give pointers and show you ways to improve your code. This isn't telling you that your code is wrong, it's simply us teaching. Whatever you don't quite understand will be explained

### What won't happen:

- You won't be told you're ever wrong
- You won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded
- You won't be put on the spot without support
- There's nothing you can do to instantly fail or blow it.
