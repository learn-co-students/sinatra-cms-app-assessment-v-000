# Sinatra Portfolio Project

This is my Sinatra Portfolio Project!  I created an app to keep track of my favorite workouts that I enjoy doing! We can create am account and create/edit/view/delete workout routines. You can also see all of th workout routines that othe rusers have uploaded and search by a user to see all of thier workouts created.
