/// Free Musician's Union ///

This code is a beta version for a website that lets musicians rate and analyze their experiences with clubs they do business with.  As musicians we sometimes have unfavorable and favorable experiences with venues.  Some clubs are fair to musicians. Some clubs will underpay and generally rip musicians off.  This site is for musicians that want to know what they're getting into before they do business with a venue.  Many times touring musicians don't know what they're getting into so this website lets you check out what locals and out of towners are saying about the venue.  Users / Musicians are meant to be completely anonymous so please do not create a user name that identifies you at all - even if you are posting something positive.
